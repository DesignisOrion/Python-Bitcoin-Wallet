# Python-Bitcoin-Wallet
A Bitcoin wallet created using Python.

### Overview:

Today I wanted to learn more about crytocurrency and the trading markets. It gave me an idea to work on a python project of creating a bitcoin wallet. In this project, I learned about the bitcoinlib library, generating HD key and creating a new address. The bitcoinlib library is still in beta so I would'nt advise using for live production. Hope you enjoy.



### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- bitcoinlib
